A 	: Btw, How was your holiday guys? I bet it was fun. Mine was so-so since I didn’t go anywhere during the holiday. 
C	:That was too bad, A. If I had known you going nowhere during the holiday, I would have asked you to come along with me to Bali.
A 	: It’s okay, friends. Even though I stayed at home only, my holiday was not that bad.
B	: Really? 
A 	:Yeah, I have a cousin from Palembang who visited me on last holiday. We had family time during the holiday. You know, we had barbeque party and played some family games together. 
D 	: woooww that’s great.

C	: Of course, it was. Me and my sister went surfing in Nusa Lembongan
A	: Wait, you can surf
C	: Yes, I can
A	: I didn’t know you can do that. 
C	: Well, now you do. 
D	: Is the waves in Nusa Lembongan very strong, C?
C	: Of course, that’s the reason why I chose Nusa Lembangon to holiday.
B	: Did you only go surfing when you visited Bali? 
C	: Of course not. I also visited some cool places there, such as Mount Batur, Uluwatu 	Temple, and Ubud Art Market. Speaking of Ubud Art Market. Having visited some 	cool place, I brought you some souvenirs from there. Here they are. 
D	: Wow, it’s so cool. Thanks, C
B	: Thanks, C
A	: Yes, it’s really pretty. You’re the best, C.
B	: So, how about you, D?
D	: My father and I went to Raja Ampat, Papua. You know that?
A	; Wow, it’s so awesome. How long to get there?
D	: 4 hours 20 minutes is the flight from Jakarta to Sorong.
C	: Then, how was your trip from Sorong to Raja Ampat?

D	: I diving on Friwen island, there has a beach with a beautiful underwater view.
A	: It was funny. Did you took a picture?
D	: Wait, here it is.
B	: OMG.. it is a beautiful sea.
D	: Of course, I hope we will be there guys.
A	: By the way guys, we only have 2 weeks off.  I thought how about we go on vacation 		together?  I think it will be a beautiful moment before our graduation
C	: nice idea!  we can have fun together
B	: I don't seem to agree.  it's true, we can have fun together, but we have to study for 	the final exam later
D	: Ofcourse we have to study for the final exam, but I think this will be our best 		moment.
C	: If so, where do you think we will go on vacation, guys?  I’m not sure we can get 	enough vacation in two weeks
A	: how about a foreign holiday? I know a good tourist spot in Malaysia
B	: I don’t think so. It takes a lont time to go abroad. Especially when we only have to weeks
C	: That’s right, how about Raja Ampat?
D	: Of course not. I have vacationed at Raja Ampat, how can we go vacation there again
C	: Ah, sorry I forgot about it
B	: Yeah, I think Raja Ampat is still too far away. Moreover, we are only there for 2 weeks
A	: I agree with B. we won’t able to explore it in two weeks
D	: How about Komodo Islands? We can explore there, can’t we?
C	: Of course, but I don’t think we should do anything strenuous on the holidays. I'm afraid we’ll get sick and can’t go to school
D	: How about Toba Lake? It is known as the largest volcanic lake in the world
A	: No way, we don’t have enough time for an off-island vacation. We should just take a vacation in java so we won’t be in a hurry later
B	: I think Tangkuban Perahu is the best choice. Tangkuban perahu has an easy hiking trail for beginner like us
C	: as far as I know about tangkuban perahu, I’m less interested in tangkuban perahu view
A	: How about Borobudur Temple in Central Java? I really want to take a trip there
D	: Great idea, we can also learn about the history of the Hindu-Buddhist religion in java there
B	: Reading Javanese folklore, I was eager to take a holiday there.
C	: isn’t is boring to take 2 weeks vacation only at the Borobudur temple?
B	: How about a week in Borobudur and a week elsewhere?
A	: Agree, how about Tumpak Sewu? It has really amazing panorama
D	: Where is the location of the Tumpak Sewu waterfall?
C	: Omg, don’t you know? That’s in Malang, east java
B	: How could you not know it? Even though you are a native of East Java
D	: Ooops, sorry guys I really don’t know about it. If you guys think it,s a good place, then we’ll go there after returning from Borobudur Temple
C	: How about the transportation? We have to save money so we can spend money for shopping
A	: Don’t worry I know good and cheap travel to get there
D	: How about the inn? We have to find a good and strategically located inn
B	: Of course, also a cheap inn
D	: Calm down, I will find and book it for us
C	: When are we going?
