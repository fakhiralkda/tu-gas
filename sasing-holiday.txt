D	: Of course not. I have vacationed at Raja Ampat, how can we go vacation there again
C	: Ah, sorry I forgot about it

A	: I agree with B. we won’t able to explore it in two weeks
D	: How about Komodo Islands? We can explore there, can’t we?
C	: Ofcourse, but I don’t think we should do anything strenuous on the holidays. I'm afraid we’ll get sick and can’t go to school
